##What will smartvotes do for community?

An ultimate cure for cancer was the biggest holy grail of medicine for decades. However time has shown, that instead of ultimate cure, there are many potent, but narrow-targeted drugs. So are counter-abuse mechanisms in Steem network. 

One of biggest advantages of steem is that it utilizes human resources to distinguish between good and bad content. People are encouraged to vote and flag by financial reward. It is designed to resist most of abuses, however there are people who somehow try to bend the rules. Moreover there are users, who, create imprecise and misleading content in professional fields. Even though they do it in a good faith, it is mostly impossible for layman to tell if professionaly looking pseudo-scientific article tells the truth or not. Another problem is that it is hard for minnows to join forces in a vote-flag figth with malicious whale. These are some of the wide variety of steem community problems. Probably there won't by any single tool to treat them all, but as with cancer drugs, there are many wise, narrow-targeted initiatives. Among them smartvote system is here, to even the odds in a fight with:

- Misleading pseudo-science — by allowing community to appoint professional authorities to a position of curators in the field of their knowledge
- Abusive whales — through the ability to join forces of many minnows under common leadership
